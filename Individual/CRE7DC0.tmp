\begin{problem}
Compute $2^{0 + 1 \cdot 6} - 2^0 \cdot 1 + 7$.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{70}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
We follow the order of operations to obtain \begin{align*} 2^{0 + 1 \cdot 6} - 2^0 \cdot 1 + 7 &= 2^{0 + 6} - 1 \cdot 1 + 7 \\ &= 2^6 - 1 + 7 \\ &= 64 - 1 + 7 = \boxed{70}. \end{align*}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
The sum of the digits of the year $2016$ is $2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 9$. What is the next year for which the sum of the digits is also $9$?
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
\boxed{2025}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
Note that for $2017, 2018$, and $2019$ have sum of digits greater than $9$. The sum of digits of $2020$ is $4$, so we need $9-4 = 5$ more years. Hence $\boxed{2025}$ is the next year with sum of digits equal to $9$.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
Compute $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots +  63$.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{2016}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
Note that $1 + 63 = 64$, $2 + 62 = 64$, $3 + 61 = 64$, and so forth. Therefore $(1 + 63) + (2 + 62) + (3 + 61) + \cdots (63 + 1) = 63 \cdot 64$is twice the desired sum. Thus the desired sum is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 63 \cdot 64 = 63 \cdot 32 = \boxed{2016}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}%[Kyle]
Two circles with equal radii are placed inside a $16 \times 18$ rectangular box as shown in the diagram. Each circle touches two walls of the box. The two circles are also touching each other at one point inside the box. What is the radius of both circles?
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{asy}
        import graph;
        unitsize(4);
        draw((0, 0) -- (16, 0) -- (16, 18) -- (0, 18) -- cycle);
        draw(Circle((5, 5), 5));
        draw(Circle((11, 13), 5));
        label("16", (8, 0), S);
        label("18", (0, 9), W);
        \end{asy}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
5
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
The point of tangency of the circles is the center of the rectangle. Therefore, we can compress the original rectangle by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ to make one of its corners lie on the tangency point of the two circles, as shown. Then we add in line segments representing the radii of one of our circles, each radius directed toward a different point of tangency.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{asy}
        import graph;
        unitsize(4);
        draw((0, 0) -- (16, 0) -- (16, 18) -- (0, 18) -- cycle);
        draw((5, 5) -- (8, 9));
        draw((5, 5) -- (5, 0));
        draw((5, 5) -- (0, 5));
        draw((0, 9) -- (8, 9) -- (8, 0));
        filldraw((5, 5) -- (8, 5) -- (8, 9) -- cycle, grey);
        draw(Circle((5, 5), 5));
        draw(Circle((11, 13), 5));
        label("8", (4, 0), S);
        label("9", (0, 4.5), W);
        \end{asy}
    \end{center}

Now we consider the shaded right triangle in the diagram. If we let $r$ be the radius of the circle, the right triangle has legs of length $8-r$ and $9-r$ and hypotenuse of length $r$. Thus, by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $(8-r)^2 + (9-r)^2 = r^2$, which reduces to $r^2 - 34r + 145 = 0$. Factoring this gives us $(r-5)(r-29) = 0$. The radius of the circle cannot be $29$ (the circle needs to fit inside a $16 \times 18$ box), so our only solution si $r = \boxed{5}$.

\begin{problem}
There are $2016$ mathematicians at the Annual Mathematics Conference, and each mathematician brought along a nonmathematician partner. NAME, a mathematician, brought NAME, a journalist, who asked each of the $4031$ people besides himself how many people they knew besides themselves and their partner. (Knowing is, so if person $A$ knows person $B$ then person $B$ knows person $A$.) NAME received a different answer from each person. Compute the number of people that NAME knows.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{2016}$ (people)

\begin{problem}%[Josh]
Quadrilateral $ABCD$ has sides $AB = 1008$, $BC = 2016$, and $CD = 2016$. If $\angle BAD$ is a right angle and $m\angle ADC = \frac{1}{2}m\angle BCD$, compute $m\angle BCD$ in degrees.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{108}$ (degrees)
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
% INCLUDE DIAGRAM
Reflect the quadrilateral about side $AD$, and let $B'$ be the reflection of $B$ and $C'$ that of $C$. Then pentagon $BCDC'D'$ is equilateral. Furthermore, $\angle BCD \cong \angle CDC' \cong DC'B'$, this construction is uniquely defined, and our pentagon is in fact a regular pentagon. Therefore $\angle BCD$ is an angle in a regular pentagon, so it measures $\boxed{108^\circ}$.
\end{solution}
