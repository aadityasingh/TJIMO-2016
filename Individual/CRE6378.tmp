\begin{problem}
Compute $2^{0 + 1 \cdot 6} - 2^0 \cdot 1 + 7$.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{70}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
We follow the order of operations to obtain \begin{align*} 2^{0 + 1 \cdot 6} - 2^0 \cdot 1 + 7 &= 2^{0 + 6} - 1 \cdot 1 + 7 \\ &= 2^6 - 1 + 7 \\ &= 64 - 1 + 7 = \boxed{70}. \end{align*}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
The sum of the digits of the year $2016$ is $2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 9$. What is the next year for which the sum of the digits is also $9$?
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
\boxed{2025}
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
Note that for $2017, 2018$, and $2019$ have sum of digits greater than $9$. The sum of digits of $2020$ is $4$, so we need $9-4 = 5$ more years. Hence $\boxed{2025}$ is the next year with sum of digits equal to $9$.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
Compute $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots +  63$.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{2016}$
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
Note that $1 + 63 = 64$, $2 + 62 = 64$, $3 + 61 = 64$, and so forth. Therefore $(1 + 63) + (2 + 62) + (3 + 61) + \cdots (63 + 1) = 63 \cdot 64$is twice the desired sum. Thus the desired sum is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 63 \cdot 64 = 63 \cdot 32 = \boxed{2016}$.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
There are $2016$ mathematicians at the Annual Mathematics Conference, and each mathematician brought along a nonmathematician partner. NAME, a mathematician, brought NAME, a journalist, who asked each of the $4031$ people besides himself how many people they knew besides themselves and their partner. (Knowing is, so if person $A$ knows person $B$ then person $B$ knows person $A$.) NAME received a different answer from each person. Compute the number of people that NAME knows.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{2016}$ (people)
\end{answer}

\begin{problem}%[Josh]
Quadrilateral $ABCD$ has sides $AB = 1008$, $BC = 2016$, and $CD = 2016$. If $\angle BAD$ is a right angle and $m\angle ADC = \frac{1}{2}m\angle BCD$, compute $m\angle BCD$ in degrees.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
$\boxed{108}$ (degrees)
\end{answer}

\begin{solution}
% INCLUDE DIAGRAM
Reflect the quadrilateral about side $AD$, and let $B'$ be the reflection of $B$ and $C'$ that of $C$. Then pentagon $BCDC'D'$ is equilateral. Furthermore, $\angle BCD \cong \angle CDC' \cong DC'B'$, this construction is uniquely defined, and our pentagon is in fact a regular pentagon. Therefore $\angle BCD$ is an angle in a regular pentagon, so it measures $\boxed{108^\circ}$.
\end{solution}
